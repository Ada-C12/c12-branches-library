<h2>New Book Form</h2>

<%# This is how we render a partial with the name _form.html.erb ! %>
<%# Sometimes we want to pass a local variable to the partial. That's the locals part! %>
<%# For every local variable that we want to define for our partial, we put it in locals (Just as a reminder, locals is a hash) %>
<%= render partial: "form", locals: { submit_button_label: "Create Book", book_form_class: "new-book-form" } %>
